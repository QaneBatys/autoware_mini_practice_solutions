The problem: car stops at the end of the path despite user goal.

I added goal position to waypoints lists setting velocity the same
as last waypoints, basically 0. 
I thought I was doing the second case, but i think it is not what they wanted.
Local planner see waypoint at end goal and see its velocity equals to 0, that is why
vehicle stops at the goal position.
